# Hi there, I'm Wuyika Serge Kevin üëã

I'm a **Results-oriented Mobile Software Engineer** with over 4 years of experience crafting high-performance iOS and Android applications using **Flutter** and **Dart**. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and enhance user satisfaction through robust, pixel-perfect, and efficient mobile solutions.

### üöÄ What I'm Good At:

-   **Building Robust Apps:** From concept to deployment, I specialize in developing scalable and performant mobile applications.
-   **Optimizing Performance:** I focus on efficient state management (using **Flutter BLoC**) and code optimization, leading to enhanced user engagement and reduced crash rates (e.g., 50% reduction in crash rates in a ride-sharing app).
-   **Pixel-Perfect UIs:** Implementing designs with high fidelity, ensuring a flawless user experience (zero UI bug reports achieved!).
-   **Streamlining Workflows:** Experienced in implementing automated testing and **CI/CD pipelines (Codemagic CI/CD, GitHub Actions)**, significantly reducing deployment times (by 30%).
-   **API Integration:** Seamlessly integrating RESTful and custom APIs (e.g., Parse Server, Open Route Service) for efficient asynchronous data handling and optimized communication.
-   **Real-time Features:** Implementing real-time notifications and dynamic content delivery.
